## Installing on your own Discourse

Follow the [instructions for installing plugins into Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-plugins-in-discourse/19157).

Currently the testing branch is where the up to date code is, so you'll need to add this line to your `containers/app.yml`:

`- git clone https://github.com/fission-suite/discourse-ipfs-file-store.git -b "v1"`

Follow the [Fission Guide to register a new user / API key on the command line](https://guide.fission.codes/apps/getting-started). This gets filled into the Discourse settings for username and password (see screenshot above).

For best results, use the Fission gateway: `ipfs.runfission.com`
